            <h2 class="career-path">MY JOURNEY</h2>
            <p>A web developer and a graphic designer born and raised in Kenya’s ancient city, Mombasa.
                I am a great story teller by default and that’s a chronic disease I am suffering from. 
                My career journey began in a funny style by sketching crazy imaginary logos and images 
                using free hand method until the day I realized the power of Adobe Creative Suite to make
                digital professional logos, picture optimization and other design products. As time flew,
                I developed great passion towards the field of graphic design and flexed my efforts to learn
                various Adobe Creative Suite packages; adobe illustrator, adobe Photoshop, adobe InDesign 
                and adobe XD which are the pillars to graphic design. After being competent with graphic design,
                I discovered the connection and great relationship between graphic design and web design. 
                For example; “for one to make mobile UI/UX designs, web mock-ups, prototypes and wireframes, 
                he/she must have a good understanding of graphic design first.” Therefore, I adjusted my scope 
                of study to web designing and later combined with my great coding skills in HTML, CSS, SASS and JavaScript 
                to become a top notch web developer, my primary and 
                collective title.

            <h3>EDUCATION</h3><br>
            <p>Fortunately, my education journey was smooth in transition with a series of successive stages/phases. 
                I completed my primary school education at Maji Safi primary school at Likoni sub-county in the year 
                2009. Later on, I joined Allidina Visram High School in the year 2010 to pursue my secondary education 
                and completed in the year 2013. Afterwards, I went on and joined Meru University of Science and 
                Technology in the year 2014 to pursue a four-year degree course in Bachelor of science in computer 
                science and completed my course in the year 2018 but graduated in early 2019.

            <h3>EXPERIENCE</h3><br>
            <p>I have 3 years of experience since I commenced my career journey as a freelancing web developer as well 
                as a graphic designer. While pursuing my tertiary level education (university), I also managed to 
                undertake industrial attachment twice in different high profiled organizations; both at the Kenya 
                Ports Authority in 2017 for 3months and at Kenya School of Government in 2018 for 3months which 
                aggregates to 6months extra of experience. Currently, I am working in the ministry of education as an 
                ICT officer with an objective of facilitating DIGITAL LITERACY PROGRAMME and coming up with innovations 
                to enhance E-learning.

            <h3>QUALIFICATIONS</h3><br>
            <p>In my entire education journey, I yielded different certificates with distinct grades in each phase. 
                On completing my primary school education, I scored a grade of A-. After sitting for my national 
                secondary school exam, I scored a grade of B+. In my tertiary education(university), I attained a 
                Second Class Upper Division honor. As a proof of all these, I have attached my certificates for one
