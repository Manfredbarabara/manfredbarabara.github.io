        <p class="text">With great coding skills and in-depth knowledge in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SASS, frameworks (React JS), 
            Git and GitHub, I translate the wireframes and mock-ups into code or rather taking the design concept
            from the client and implement it through code and add functionality to a website on the client side.
            I am responsible for behavior and visuals that run in the user browser so that the users can view and 
            interact with a particular website they are visiting. With the continuing development for mobile devices,
            such as smart phones and tablets, I usually ensure that my sites come up correctly in browsers on all devices.
            As a developer, I chiefly concerned with render time, by manipulating the HTML, CSS and JavaScript to ensure
            that the site opens up quickly. Consequently, I provide clean code with pixel perfect design, make sure that
            the website works correctly across all devices and works/loads as fast as possible.

            responsiveness of a website through the use of color, images, typography and layout hence bringing a

            A responsible design makes your website accessible to all users, irrespective of their devices and
            variations in screen sizes. I am also deeply concerned with images/pictures quality by greatly
            considering the variations in mobile devices screen types and qualities such as OLED, AMOLED & retina
            screens during my web design projects to avoid pixelated images (blurry) in advanced screens.
